# CLI reference

`cctl` runs local, one-shot commands over the switch engine and the daemon's data, plus
the guided first-run wizard and the background daemon itself. Bare `cctl` (no
subcommand) prints `Not set up yet. Run: cctl setup` before setup, or a short status
summary afterward — it never dumps raw command-tree usage. `cctl --help` lists every
command; this page adds the detail and the unhappy paths.

## First run

```
cctl setup
```

The guided wizard: environment doctor → capture your current account → optional
add-more-accounts loop → usage hooks → relay → Discord pairing → autostart + start the
daemon → round-trip verify. See `docs/SETUP.md` for the full step-by-step walkthrough,
every prompt, and every unhappy path.

## Accounts

```
cctl accounts list                 # list stored accounts (active marked with *)
cctl accounts add <label>          # capture the currently logged-in account
cctl accounts add <label> --fresh  # log in as a NEW account in a throwaway window,
                                    # without touching the live login
cctl accounts remove <id|label>    # remove a stored account
```

## Switching and recovery

```
cctl switch <id|label>       # activate an account
cctl switch <id|label> --force   # bypass the switch-cadence guard
cctl recover                 # recover from an interrupted switch (safe to run anytime)
```

## Usage and timeline

```
cctl usage      # cross-account usage from the daemon's latest poll
cctl timeline   # 5h-session budget per account + when every limit resets, with a
                # burn-down plan
```

Both read the daemon's last-persisted snapshot, so they work whether or not the daemon
is currently running.

## Status and settings

```
cctl status     # at-a-glance: accounts, hooks, relay, daemon, pairing
cctl settings   # every configurable setting: effective value and where it came from
                # (flag / env / config / default), for both this shell and the
                # last-started daemon
cctl doctor     # environment checks: Node version, vault crypto round-trip, vault dir,
                # live login, ~/.claude.json
```

## The daemon

The daemon is the one long-running local process: usage poller, hook receiver,
attribution journal, and the control-plane connection to the bot.

```
cctl daemon run                        # run in the foreground (Ctrl+C to stop)
cctl daemon run --pair <code>          # adopt a new identity from a Discord /pair code
cctl daemon run --relay <url>          # override the control-plane WebSocket url
cctl daemon run --auto-switch          # auto-switch when the active account runs low
cctl daemon run --auto-switch --greedy # also hop toward whichever account's weekly
                                        # quota expires soonest, even while healthy

cctl daemon supervise                  # run + auto-restart on crash or hang (same flags
                                        # as `daemon run`; a clean exit ends supervision)

cctl daemon install     # register the logon Scheduled Task and start the daemon now
cctl daemon uninstall   # remove the logon task + the daemon's hook entries in settings.json
cctl daemon status      # logon task, heartbeat, pairing, relay — at a glance
```

`cctl daemon install`/`uninstall` are idempotent: install checks the current
registration first and only calls `Register-ScheduledTask` when the resolved action
actually differs, so re-running it (e.g. re-entering `cctl setup`) is a fast no-op. A
second daemon instance is refused up front with an actionable message naming the
running daemon's pid, not a raw exception.

`cctl daemon uninstall` also prunes the daemon's own hook entries from
`~/.claude/settings.json` — only entries it installed; other tools' hooks and the rest
of the file are untouched. Hook removal is best-effort: if settings.json can't be
touched (e.g. it isn't valid JSON), the command prints a warning but the task removal
still counts as a success. Neither step stops an already-running daemon, and a running
daemon reinstalls its hooks on its next start — stop it for the removal to stick.

`cctl daemon supervise` respawns the daemon a couple of seconds after a crash (with a
cooldown if it crash-loops), probes its local health endpoint, and kills + respawns a
daemon that is alive but unresponsive. Crashes leave a line in `daemon-crash.log`
beside the vault.

A running daemon writes a heartbeat roughly every 30 seconds; `cctl daemon status` and
`cctl status` read it to tell "connected 12s ago" from "dead since 3h" apart from
whether the logon task is registered at all. A stale heartbeat with a registered task
reads as "will restart at next logon", not just a bare timestamp.

## Session tracking

```
cctl session register       # opt the current session into daemon tracking + phone streaming
cctl session label <name>   # name the current tracked session (shown in the phone list)
cctl session watch [--off]  # stream the current session to Discord (--off to stop)
cctl session unregister     # stop tracking (by the current session, --session <id>, or --label <name>)
cctl session status         # show tracked sessions + active account (reads the daemon db offline)
```

`register`/`label`/`watch`/`unregister` talk to the running daemon over its loopback
receiver; `status` reads the local database and works offline. The group is also
exposed in-session as the `/cctl:*` slash commands shipped in `plugins/cctl/` — a
self-contained Claude Code plugin that holds no secrets and only wraps the CLI.

## Pairing

```
cctl pair              # prompts for the code interactively
cctl pair <code>       # bind this machine to the Discord bot using a one-time /pair code
cctl pair <code> --relay <url>
```

Pairing codes are case-insensitive and tolerate stray whitespace/dashes (`AB-CD 12` and
`abcd12` pair identically). `cctl pair` only adopts and persists the daemon identity —
start (or restart) the daemon afterward to actually connect (`cctl daemon install` or
`cctl setup`).

Failure is reason-specific, never a raw error:

- **Relay unreachable** (the wizard/pair's own ~15s timeout fired, since
  `ControlPlaneClient.connect()` reconnects forever and never rejects on its own) →
  checks a firewall/proxy hint and the `--relay <url>` override.
- **Relay refused the code** → codes are one-time and expire; run `/pair` again for a
  fresh one.

## Remote control

```
cctl run   # (needs the running daemon + hosted bot) start a remote session
```

Until the daemon is connected to the bot, `cctl run` fails with a pointer to
`docs/VERIFICATION.md` rather than doing nothing silently.

## Relay override precedence

Every command that talks to the relay resolves the url the same way, highest
precedence first: `--relay <url>` flag → `CCTL_RELAY_URL` env var → `relayUrl` in
`config.json` → the built-in default. `cctl settings` shows the effective value and
which of the four produced it.

`config.json` lives beside the vault (the same directory as `daemon.db`; run
`cctl settings` to see the resolved path) and is the option that survives a reboot
without a wrapper script or a machine-wide env var:

```json
{ "relayUrl": "wss://relay.example.com" }
```

A missing, corrupt, or wrong-shaped file is ignored rather than being a startup
error, so a typo costs you the override, never the daemon. Do not confuse it with
`daemon-settings.json` in the same directory: that one is written _by_ the daemon to
report what it resolved, and editing it changes nothing.

## Building from source

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

`cctl` is then available unbundled at `packages/cli/dist/bin.js`
(`pnpm --filter @claude-control/cli build`, then `node packages/cli/dist/bin.js --help`).
The published `@claude-control/cctl` package (`packages/cctl-publish`) is a separate
single-file esbuild bundle of the same CLI + daemon — see that package for the
prepublish smoke test that guards it.
