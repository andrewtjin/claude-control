// The switch engine: the safety-critical core of the whole system.
//
// `activate(id)` makes an account's credentials the live ones, with these guarantees:
//   1. Mutual exclusion with our other processes (file lock).
//   2. The previous account's live token, if the CLI rotated it under us, is ADOPTED into
//      the vault before we overwrite anything (reconcile-by-reading) — never lost.
//   3. The target's token is refreshed if near expiry, and the rotated (single-use) token is
//      persisted to the vault IMMEDIATELY, before it can be lost.
//   4. Live files are written atomically, then read back and verified; a mismatch rolls back
//      to an encrypted snapshot of the prior live credentials.
//   5. A write-ahead intent makes every step crash-recoverable via `recover()`.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do: claim that a *running* interactive session picked up the
// new credentials. That is an empirical, per-platform fact (see docs/VERIFICATION.md); this
// engine reports only what it mechanically did.

   * Recompute the derived (plan/billing/identity) row of every account whose metadata predates

   *
   * The repair exists because nothing else can perform it. A row is refreshed only when its
   * bundle is rewritten, so an account added by a build that captured fewer fields keeps
   * rendering "unknown" until the day its token happens to rotate — and for fields the earlier
   * build never captured at all, that day never comes, because the data was in the bundle the
   * whole time and only the mapping was behind. Recomputing from the stored bundle (rather than
   * from the live `~/.claude.json`) is what makes this correct for EVERY account instead of only
   * whichever one is currently logged in.
   *
   * Cost is bounded and self-limiting: `needsMetadataBackfill` filters to rows that are actually
   * behind, and the lock is not taken at all when there is nothing to do — so the steady state is
   * a single registry read. EVERY selected row is stamped, whether or not it could be repaired: a
   * repaired one with the current revision, an unrepairable one (missing blob, a key this machine
   * cannot decrypt, an identity block that refuses the row) with a failure time that backs the
   * sweep off for `METADATA_BACKFILL_RETRY_MS`. Leaving an unrepairable row unstamped is what
   * turns "sweep once" into "sweep on every listing forever", because that row alone keeps the
   * stale set non-empty. An unreadable bundle is skipped rather than thrown: a listing must still
   * render for the accounts that ARE readable.
   *
   * Opportunistic by design: this is repair nobody asked for, running inside a read command, so
   * it SKIPS when another process holds the credential lock instead of queueing behind an
   * in-flight switch and stalling the caller for the whole acquire timeout. The lock is still
   * required when the work does run — `syncMetadata` is a registry read-modify-write, and doing
   * it unlocked would silently drop a concurrent switch's update. Returns 0 when it skipped;
   * nothing is lost, because the next invocation retries.
   *
   * NEVER THROWS, so a caller can run it ahead of a read without guarding it. Best-effort is a
   * property of this repair, not of the call sites, and expressing it here is what keeps the
   * reason for a failure visible: a caller reduced to `catch {}` discards the only evidence that
   * the self-heal has stopped healing, which is indistinguishable from having nothing left to do.
   * Every failure — one row's or the whole sweep's — is logged at warn instead.

   * afterwards misreports who is active everywhere downstream (the accounts listing, the
   * phone's active marker, usage attribution) and mis-routes the live-token protections in

   * mismatch overrides the registry:
   *   - the live identity matches the registry's account → the registry answer stands;

   * The identity block and the credentials live in two different files, so they can disagree,
   * and the block is the one that goes stale: the CLI rewrites it only on a login, while the
   * token changes under every rotation. Believing a stale block here is not a cosmetic error —
   * it hands the live token's owner the wrong id, which then routes `adoptRotationIfNeeded()`
   * at the wrong bundle and lets `refreshToken()` network-refresh the token the live session is

   * Same as {@link withCredentialLock}, but claims the lock only if it is free RIGHT NOW: a lock
   * someone else holds yields `undefined` and `mutate` never runs.
   *
   * For opportunistic work a user is waiting on. Waiting out the full acquire timeout is the
   * right trade for a mutation the caller explicitly asked for and nothing else can perform; it
   * is the wrong one for background self-healing, where queueing behind an in-flight switch turns
   * a fast read command into a stall for a result the caller never requested. A zero timeout
   * makes `acquireLock` attempt the claim exactly once — still reclaiming a dead holder's lock on
   * the way — and report contention as {@link LockTimeoutError}, which is a routine outcome here
   * rather than a failure. Any other acquisition error is a real fault and propagates.
